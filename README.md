# p3d-translations

This repo contains translations for [PoWH3D](https://powh.io/). 

## Overview

There are two sections to the translations:

 * [Frontend](https://github.com/mantso/p3d-translations/tree/master/frontend) - This is the [PoWH3D](https://powh.io/) homepage
 * [Exchange](https://github.com/mantso/p3d-translations/tree/master/exchange) - This is the [P3D Exchange](https://exchange.powh.io/)

Each of these is translated through a `common.json` file for each language. 

## Translating P3D to a New Language

How to translate?

1) Go to https://github.com/mantso/p3d-translations and fork the repo to your own account.
2) Create a new directory under "exchange" (for the exchange) or "frontend" (for the main website) with your country-code (i.e. de for german)
3) Create a new file called common.json and fill it with the content of the already existing common.json from the exchange/en/ or frontend/en/ directory.
4) Translate the content and open a pull request of your fork back into mantso's Github.
