We have now fully configured both the homepage and the exchange with support for internationalization. **Anyone can add support for a language.** Instructions are below:

1. [Create a Github Account](#create-a-github-account)
2. [Get a Copy of the Translations Repo](#get-a-copy-of-the-translations-repo)
3. [Translating the Exchange](#translating-the-exchange)
4. [Translating the Frontend](#translating-the-frontend)
5. [Contribute Back for Deployment](#contribute-back-for-deployment)

## Create a Github Account

In order to contribute translations, you'll need to have a [Github account](https://github.com/join). If you don't have a github account, sign up for one through that link.

## Get a Copy of the Translations Repo

We need to get our own copy of the repository to start translating:

1. The first step is to visit the [translations page on Github](https://github.com/mantso/p3d-translations). 

[![](https://i.imgur.com/dZzjqJM.png)](https://github.com/mantso/p3d-translations)

2. Click the "Fork" button on the repository to create your own copy.

3. You now have your own personal copy of the repo which can be used for translations.

You are now ready to start translating.

## Translating the Exchange

Let's start by translating the exchange:

1. First, visit [this common.json file from the main repo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mantso/p3d-translations/master/exchange/en/common.json). 

2. Copy all of the text in this file to your clipboard to paste into a new file.

3. Go to your copy that you created and click "Create new file"

4. Find your [country code](#country-codes) below (for example, `es` for Spanish or `ko` for Korean)

5. Enter the folliowing as the file name: `exchange/[country-code]/common.js`. For example, `exchange/es/common.js`.

6. Paste the full text of [this common.json file from the main repo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mantso/p3d-translations/master/exchange/en/common.json) into this new file.

7. Click "Commit new file" at the bottom of this page

8. Click into the file "common.js" that you just created. 

9. Click the pencil icon to edit this file

10. Fill out translations for your language, replacing all English phrases with the appropriate equivalent. For example, here's the English strings:

```js
{
	"masthead": {
		"holdings": "Holdings",
		"balance": "{{balance}} ETH in contract"
	},
    // ...
}
```

and then replace that with:

11. Once finished with translations or wanting to save changes, then scroll down and click "Commit changes":

12. Once you've translated all strings, then the exchange translations are complete!

## Translating the Frontend

Next, we need to translate the front-end following the same pattern:

1. First, visit [this frontend common.json file from the main repo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mantso/p3d-translations/master/frontend/en/common.json). 

2. Copy all of the text in this file to your clipboard to paste into a new file.

3. Go to your copy that you created and click "Create new file"

![](https://i.imgur.com/8ewby2K.png)

4. Find your [country code](#country-codes) below (for example, `es` for Spanish or `ko` for Korean)

5. Enter the folliowing as the file name: `frontend/[country-code]/common.js`. For example, `frontend/es/common.js`.

6. Paste the full text of [this common.json file from the main repo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mantso/p3d-translations/master/frontend/en/common.json) into this new file.

7. Click "Commit new file" at the bottom of this page

8. Click into the file "common.js" that you just created. 

9. Click the pencil icon to edit this file

10. Fill out translations for your language, replacing all English phrases with the appropriate equivalent. 

11. Once finished with translations or wanting to save changes, then scroll down and click "Commit changes":

12. Once you've translated all strings, then the frontend translations are complete!
